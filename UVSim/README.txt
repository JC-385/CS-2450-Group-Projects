This project is a simple virtual machine that inteperets basicML.
To run the program open a command console and type out python Main,
or run inside a code editor with a console like Visual studio or visual studio code.
the program input is formated to open a file with 4 digits per line
the first 2 are the operator and the last 2 are the operand
the only requirement is to have the most recent python downloaded.

When you run the Main.py the GUI will start up with the options to run a file, close the program,
reset the program, and it will also give you the option to see all the operators in the program. 

to run a file, type in the file name, and click the run button. 
When the program asks for inputs from the test file instructions it will be though the terminal, 
and it will also print out everything in the terminal. 


To run the test, you have to run this command in the terminal: pytest UVSim/Tests.py
