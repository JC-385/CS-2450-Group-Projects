        this text file willl be formated by rows with 4 digits per row
    the application will then read each row and split the digits into operator and operands
    the application will complete the operator such as (READ, WRITE, LOAD, STORE, ADD, SUBTRACT, DIVIDE, MULTIPLY, 
        BRANCH, BRANCHNEG, BRANCHZERO, and HALT )
