high-level functionality
    application asks for the name of a file
        this text file willl be formated by rows with 4 digits per row
    the application will then read each row and split the digits into operator and operands
    the application will complete the operator such as (READ, WRITE, LOAD, STORE, ADD, SUBTRACT, DIVIDE, MULTIPLY, 
        BRANCH, BRANCHNEG, BRANCHZERO, and HALT )

User Stories
    As a user I want to be able to interact with the computer at a lower level so i dont take higher level languages for granted
    as a user I want full control over what my computer computes
Use Cases
    Actor: the program
    System: memory management and code processor

    READ
        Goal: read an integer input from the keyboard into a specific memory location
        Steps:
        1.Parse function code
        2.Get user input
        3.Convert to integer
        4.Verify range
        5.Set value in memory
    WRITE
        Goal: write the value stored at a specific memory location to the screen
        Steps:
        1.Parse function code
        2.Fetch value from identified memory address
        3.Output the fetched value to the console
    LOAD
        Goal: load a value into the accumulator
        Steps:
        1.Parse function code
        2.Fetch value from specified memory address
        3.Copy fetched value into accumulator register
    STORE
        Goal: store the accumulator's value into a specific memory location
        Steps:
        1.Parse function code
        2.Copy accumulator value into specified memory address
    ADD
        Goal: add a value from memory to the accumulator and store the result in the accumulator
        Steps:
        1.Parse function code
        2.Fetch value from speciified memory address
        3.Add fetched value to accumulator
        4.Return updated accumulator value
    SUBTRACT
        Goal: subtract a value from memory from the accumulator and store the result in the accumulator
        Steps:
        1.Parse function code
        2.Fetch value from speciified memory address
        3.Subtract fetched value from accumulator
        4.Return updated accumulator value
    DIVIDE
        Goal: divide the accumulator by a value from memory and store the integer result in the accumulator
        Steps:
        1.Parse function code
        2.Fetch value from speciified memory address
        3.Divide accumulator by fetched value using integer division
        4.Return updated accumulator value
    MULTIPLY
        Goal: multiply the accumulator by a value from memory and store the result in the accumulator
        Steps:
        1.Parse function code
        2.Fetch value from speciified memory address
        3.Multiply accumulator by fetched value
        4.Return updated accumulator value
    BRANCH
        Goal: unconditionally change the instruction pointer to a specified memory address
        Steps:
        1.Parse function code
        2.Set next instruction pointer to specified address
    BRANCHNEG
        Goal: change the instruction pointer to a specified address if the accumulator is negative
        Steps:
        1.Parse function code
        2.Check accumulator sign
        3.If accumulator is negative, set next instruction pointer to specified address
    BRANCHZERO
        Goal: change the instruction pointer to a specified address if the accumulator is zero
        Steps:
        1.Parse function code
        2.Check accumulator value
        3.If accumulator equals zero, set next instruction pointer to specified address
    HALT
        Goal: stop program execution and return control to the environment
        Steps:
        1.Parse function code
        2.Set halted state to True
